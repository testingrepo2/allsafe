# Allsafe

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-for-android.svg)](https://github.com/t0thkr1s/)

Allsafe is an intentionally vulnerable application that contains various vulnerabilities. Unlike other vulnerable Android apps, this one is less like a CTF and more like a real-life application that uses modern libraries and technologies. Additionally, I have included some Frida based challenges for you to explore. Have fun and happy hacking!

#### Useful Frida Scripts
 
I have my Frida scripts (more like templates) in other repository. I'm sure they might be quite handy for the Frida related tasks. Check it out: https://github.com/t0thkr1s/frida 

## Tasks / Vulnerabilities

### 1. Insecure Logging

Simple information disclosure vulnerability. Use the `logcat` command-line tool to discover sensitive information.

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [Logcat Tool](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat)
- [Coinbase OAuth Response Code Leak](https://hackerone.com/reports/5314)

<details>
<summary>Show me how it's done!</summary>
<br>
adb shell 'pidof infosecadventures.allsafe'
<br><br>
Take output and substitue for <pid>
<br><br>
adb shell 'logcat --pid <pid> | grep secret'
<br><br>
</details>

### 2. Hardcoded Credentials

Some credentials are left in the code. Your task is to reverse engineer the app and find sensitive information.

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [Zomato Hardcoded Credentials](https://hackerone.com/reports/246995)
- [8x8 Hardcoded Credentials](https://hackerone.com/reports/412772)
- [Reverb Hardcoded API Secret](https://hackerone.com/reports/351555)

### 3. Root Detection

This is purely for Frida practice. Make the code believe that your device is not rooted!

### 4. Arbitrary Code Execution

Loading modules securely with third-party apps are not easy. Write a PoC application and exploit the vulnerability!

### 5. Secure Flag Bypass

Another Frida-based task. No real vulnerability here, just have fun bypassing the secure flag!

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [Android FLAG_SECURE Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams#FLAG_SECURE)

<details>
<summary>Show me how it's done!</summary>

### 6. Certificate Pinning Bypass

Certificate pinning is implemented using the OkHttp library. You have to bypass it in order to view the traffic with Burp Suite.

- [Certificate and Public Key Pinning](https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning)
- [Coinbase Vulnerabilities](https://hackerone.com/reports/5786)

### 7. Insecure Broadcast Receiver

There's a vulnerable broadcast recevier in the application. Trigger it with the correct data and you're done!

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [Android Broadcasts Overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts)
- [ok.ru Broadcast Receiver Exploitation](https://hackerone.com/reports/97295)

### 8. Deep Link Exploitation

Similar to the insecure broadcast receiver, you need to provide the right query parameter to complete this task!

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [Android Deep Linking](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking)
- [Grab Insecure Deep Link](https://hackerone.com/reports/401793)

### 9. SQL Injection

Just a regular SQL injection that you'd find in web applications. No need to reverse the code to bypass the login mechanism.

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [SQL Injection in Content Provider](https://hackerone.com/reports/291764)

### 10. Vulnerable WebView

You can also complete this task without decompiling the application. Pop an alert dialog and read files!

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [ownCloud WebView XSS](https://hackerone.com/reports/87835)

### 11. Smali Patching

In this task, you have to modify the execution flow of the application by editing the Smali code. Finally, rebuild and sign the APK!

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [Uber APK Signer](https://github.com/patrickfav/uber-apk-signer)

<details>
<summary>Show me how it's done!</summary>

### 12. Native Library

The application uses a native library that validates the entered password. Reverse engineer the library to find the password then use Frida to hook the native method.
